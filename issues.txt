F12 doesnt start or stop timer #5

	The F12 key is reserved for use by the debugger at all times, so it should not be registered as a hot key. Even when you are not debugging an application, F12 is reserved in case a kernel-mode debugger or a just-in-time debugger is resident.


after drag and drop, timer hotkey moves with them
